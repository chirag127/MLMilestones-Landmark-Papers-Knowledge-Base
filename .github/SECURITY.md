# Security Policy

## Overview

The integrity of the information within the `MLMilestones-Landmark-Papers-Knowledge-Base` is our top priority. We are committed to ensuring this repository remains a trusted and safe resource for the machine learning community. This policy outlines the steps to take if you discover a potential security vulnerability or critical issue with the content.

While this repository primarily contains Markdown files and curated links rather than executable code, we consider the following to be within the scope of our security policy:

- **Malicious Links:** Links that redirect to harmful websites, phishing scams, or malware downloads.
- **Data Integrity:** Gross misrepresentation of research findings or fabricated data that could mislead users.
- **Information Exposure:** Accidental inclusion of sensitive, non-public information or content that violates copyright or licensing agreements.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

To ensure vulnerabilities are handled with the necessary discretion, please report them privately using GitHub's security advisory feature.

    - The specific file or link affected.
    - A clear explanation of the potential impact (e.g., "This link redirects to a phishing site.").

We will make every effort to acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for remediation. We appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing your findings and helping us maintain the security and integrity of this project.
